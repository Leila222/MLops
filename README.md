3. **Prepare Data** - Preprocesses training and testing data. 
4. **Train Model** - Trains the machine learning model. 
5. **Evaluate Model** - Evaluates model performance. 
6. **Deploy API** - Deploys the model as a Flask API.
 
The pipeline runs automatically on GitHub changes. 

The API runs on the specified server after a successful pipeline execution.
